        <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
        <p>
          Discovering our competitors will help us analyze what is already in
          the market and find ways to further improve the experience. We do this
          by conducting SWOT and UX analysis to gain deeper understanding to
          help identify potential innovation through design. We have found that
          these apps are commonly used to get people organized and accountable
          with household utilities and responsibilities. Number one being the
          household chores.

      <h3>USER INTERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to identify the journey our users go through who have been
        or are in a house share experience. We have conducted 10 user interviews
        ranging from 22 to 40 years of age.

      <h2>SYNTHESIS</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We then extracted the information and synthesized our findings. Grouping
        and altering them until we find connections or stories as to what is
        really happening in a house share.
      </p>

      <h3>FINDINGS</h3>
      <p>
        • People who live with someone who are in some form of a relationship
        for example a workmate, a friend or a friend of a friend are more likely
        to have a bad house share experience than those who live with complete
        strangers. This is the case because people who tend to live with
        strangers are more cautious therefore intensive interviews are conducted
        and house rules are being communicated.
        <br />
        <br />
        • A house share experience becomes successful when two or more people
        share the same values. <br />
        <br />
        • People are reluctant to confront housemates to avoid tension or
        uncomfortable situations. In some cases they avoid confrontation
        altogether because they think the results might be worse or the fear of
        being judged.

      <h3>PERSONA</h3>
      <h4>Secondary persona</h4>

      <h3>JOURNEY MAP</h3>
      <p>
        The results of the research were not something we were expecting. In the
        beginning we had assumptions about the system in organizing a whole
        household. Below is Charlie's User Journey on what he goes through when
        finding a housemate to live with. As you can see it is very similar to
        the 5 stages of grief.

      <h2>IDEATION</h2>
      <hr />
      <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
      <p>
        “Charlie needs a way to communicate household expectations so that he
        can avoid feeling anxious and avoid future conflict with housemates”
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>HOW MIGHT WE'S</h4>
      <p>
        • HMW be able to let the housemates be reminded of household utilities
        so Charlie won’t have to approach them? <br />
        • HMW be able to let Charlie and his housemate know what is to be
        expected living in his place? <br />
        • HMW be able to let Charlie express his concerns without making him
        feel anxious doing so?
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>HYPOTHESIS</h4>
      <p>
        We believe that by creating an app that facilitates and mediates within
        the household for Charlie, We will create and encourage more harmonious
        living for both housemates. We know this to be true if both parties are
        able to meet awareness of house expectations and have minimal
        confrontation as possible.
